# The Future Isn't Centralized, It's Personalized

srswti-axis (AI eXplainable Inference & Search) is an industry-ready machine learning library for advanced data retrieval and interpretable AI solutions. it provides a collection of powerful components and state-of-the-art capabilities that run entirely locally on your machine. we focused on efficient implementations that deliver high performance even on modest hardware.

## Key Features
- Local intelligenceâ€”too cheap to meter, firewall-protected for privacy, on-premise steerable, and rendering benchmarks obsolete
- Everything what LLMs do but much faster, averaging 50-100ms latency 
- Industry-ready
- Zero-shot classification <70ms latency
- Advanced text cleaning and preprocessing
- Intelligent text analysis and NER
- Document clustering and ranking
- Neural-probabilistic hybrid search
- Multi-strategy document merging
- Multilingual translation support
- Sentiment analysis

# Installation

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 - 3.11

## Setting up Virtual Environment

Create a new virtual environment using uv:
```bash
uv venv --python 3.10
```

Activate the virtual environment:

For Unix/macOS:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Installing the Package

Using uv:
```bash
uv pip install srswti-axis
```

Or using traditional pip:
```bash
pip install srswti-axis
```

## Install Required Dependencies

Inside activated virtual environment:
```bash
srswti-axis-post-install
```
this command takes a little time at first depending on your hardware. 

# Notebooks Usage

> Note: We will be updating the notebooks section in the coming days to provide plug-and-play examples for using SRSWTI Axis. Check back soon for comprehensive Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the full capabilities of the framework.

**We are optimizing our frameworks every day. Please email us at team@srswti.com or raise an issue here, and we will typically respond in less than an hour!**

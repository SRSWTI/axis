# SRSWTI Search Engine

An advanced hybrid search system combining BM25 ranking, semantic embeddings, and proximity-based scoring for sophisticated document retrieval.

## Quick Start

```python
from srswti_axis import SRSWTISearchEngine

# Initialize the search engine
engine = SRSWTISearchEngine(embedding_model='srswti-neural-embedder-v1')

# Perform hybrid search
results = engine.hybrid_search(
    query="machine learning",
    documents=docs,
    weights={'bm25': 0.4, 'semantic': 0.4, 'proximity': 0.2}
)
```

## Core Features

### 1. Hybrid Search Components

- **BM25 Ranking**: Traditional keyword-based relevance scoring
- **Semantic Search**: Neural embedding-based similarity
- **Proximity Scoring**: Term distance-based relevance
- **Query Expansion**: Automated query enhancement

### 2. Text Processing Pipeline

```python
# Advanced text preprocessing
processed_text = engine.preprocess_text("Your text here")

# Query expansion
expanded_query = engine.expand_query("machine learning")
```

### 3. Customizable Weights

```python
# Emphasize BM25 scoring
custom_weights = {
    'bm25': 0.6,
    'semantic': 0.3,
    'proximity': 0.1
}

results = engine.hybrid_search(
    query=query,
    documents=documents,
    weights=custom_weights
)
```

## Detailed Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Document Search

```python
# Initialize search engine
search_engine = SRSWTISearchEngine()

# Sample documents
documents = [
    "The integration of transformer-based architectures with reinforcement learning has enabled breakthrough advances in robotics control and decision making",
    "Quantum machine learning algorithms leverage superposition and entanglement to achieve exponential speedups on specific optimization problems",
    "Federated learning enables distributed model training across edge devices while preserving data privacy and reducing central computation needs",
    "Multi-modal foundation models can process text, images, audio and video simultaneously to understand complex real-world scenarios",
    "Graph neural networks combined with attention mechanisms have revolutionized molecular property prediction and drug discovery",
    "Zero-shot learning capabilities allow models to generalize to unseen tasks by leveraging semantic relationships between concepts"
]

# Perform search with complex technical query
query = "novel machine learning architectures for distributed and privacy-preserving computation"
results = search_engine.hybrid_search(query, documents)

# Process results
for idx, score in results:
    print(f"Score: {score:.4f} - {documents[idx]}")
```

### 2. Advanced Search Configuration

```python
# Initialize with custom embedding model
engine = SRSWTISearchEngine(
    embedding_model='all-mpnet-base-v2'  # Custom model
)

# Configure logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s [SRSWTI-IR] %(levelname)s: %(message)s'
)
```

### 3. Testing Search Methods

```python
def test_search_pipeline():
    # Initialize engine
    engine = SRSWTISearchEngine()
    
    # Test documents
    documents = [
        "Machine learning is a powerful technology for data analysis",
        "Artificial intelligence helps solve complex problems",
        "Data science involves statistical modeling and machine learning techniques"
    ]
    
    # Test queries
    test_queries = [
        "machine learning",
        "data science",
        "artificial intelligence"
    ]
    
    # Run tests
    for query in test_queries:
        # Test query expansion
        expanded_query = engine.expand_query(query)
        print(f"Original: {query}")
        print(f"Expanded: {expanded_query}\n")
        
        # Test search
        results = engine.hybrid_search(query, documents)
        for idx, score in results:
            print(f"Score: {score:.4f} - {documents[idx]}")
```
